Hello, this folder contains libraries and sketch to handle a Rs485 Modbus link to send data from master to slave
in this case the master take readings from potentiometer (values between 0 and 255) and send it this values to slave

the slave take this values and make a flashing with a delay between flashes according a values from master.

also you can see the  values that it send  from master with a LCD RGB display

Mode employ

first you need install the libraries:

-       SimpleModbusMaster.h
-       SimpleModbusMaster.cpp
-  	SimpleModbusSlave.h
-  	SimpleModbusSlave.cpp



if you wnat to connect a LCD RGB the slave, you need add this libraries

-  	rgb_lcd.cpp
-       rgb_lcd.h
